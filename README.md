<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Airbnb is very popular and of course, in Cape Town we often wonder about the density of listings because its very expensive to rent as a local. So I decided to check out this data and investigate the foundational aspects of this landscape.

Some key questions / areas of investigation I hade were:

(1) Listings Dataset:
What does the price distribution look like in Cape Town & for specific Areas?
What is the difference in pricing between the property types?
What is the difference in pricing between areas / wards ?
How many hosts have multiple listings and where are they?
What is the difference between superhosts and normal hosts pricing?

(2) Reviews Dataset:
What are the reviews like for Cape Town hosts, good or bad?
How does demand fluctuate for AirBnb in Cape Town?
Is there the expected seasonality with seasons?
Is there higher demand with less seasonality in certain areas?

(3) Price Prediction:
As a new host, if you try to charge above market price for a listing, then renters will select more affordable alternatives which are similar. If you set price too low, you will miss out on potential revenue as well.

The k nearest neighbours results were not incredible, but lay a decent foundation to build upon.

It would be great to extend this to specific areas in the data, and also build out some more powerful models with more features.

Also, there is a Boat & Cave listing in Cape Town that was found!
